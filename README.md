# RasmusÂ´s Pokemon game
This is a fun project solely made for my personal entertainment.<br>
My personal goal for the project was to enhance my Python skills and have FUN!<br>
The project is made with Pygame, which handles the game window.<br>
<br>

### How to play
If you wish to play the game, simply:<br>
1: Pull this repository<br>
2: Run the "Pokemon_pygame_window.py" file<br>
3: Have fun <br>
<br>

### Features
This game simply consists of the logic behind the Pokemon game battles from Nintendo.<br>
All you can really do for now is to select a Pokemon, battle and save your progress.<br> 
Oh yeah... the save feature is pretty neat if you wish to expand upon it :smile: <br>
